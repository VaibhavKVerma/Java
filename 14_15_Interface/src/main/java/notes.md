Interface
Helps achieve abstraction
- Public and Default Modifiers are allowed
- Comma separated list of parent interfaces
- Methods cannot be final
- Fields are by default public static final
- normal class has to implement methods for interface
- abstract class can/cannot implement methods for interface
