# Concrete Class
- It is a class which is not abstract and implements all the abstract methods
- Must be instantiated using new keyword
# Abstract Class
- Cannot be instantiated using new keyword
- Interface/Abstract Class
- Abstract class can have child as a abstract class
- There are abstract methods and non-abstract methods
- Concrete class has to implement all the abstract methods
# Super and Sub Class
- Parent class is called Super Class
- Child class is called Sub Class
- If there is a single class then the Super Class will be <b>Object Class</b>(Java Predefined Class)
# Nested Class
Class within a Class
- Static Nested Class - Static Class within a class
- Non-Static Nested Class/Inner Class
  - Local Inner Class - Inner Class within a method
  - Member Inner Class - Inner Class within a class
  - Anonymous Inner Class - Inner Class without name(when we want to override the method without creating any subclass)
# Generic Class
- It is a class which is parameterized with type parameters using <T> keyword
- Bounded Generics
  - Upper Bound(<T extends Number>) meaning T can be a member of Number class or its subclass. Here we can use interface.
  - Multi Bound
